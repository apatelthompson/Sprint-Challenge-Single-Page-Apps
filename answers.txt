1) Explain benefit(s) using client-side routing?
Answer: Route is handled by the JS on the page - clicking on the link will make the URL change but not make a request to the server. Instead, it will change the state of the application and change the view by rendering another component or getting more data from the server.
- Importantly, the whole page won’t refresh - only the elements that need to be. Because of this, the routing between views is faster and you can create slicker animations/transitions.
